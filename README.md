# StockTracker
An application that models the ups and downs of a particular stock. The value of a stock is assumed to change by plus or minus a specified number of units after every time unit (such as one hour). A notification is generated each time a stock changes more than a specified number of units above or below its initial value. A collection of brokers who control the stock must receive this notification. The range within which the stock can change every time unit and the threshold above or below which collection of brokers who control the stock must be notified are specified when the stock is created (using its constructor).
